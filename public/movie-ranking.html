        <h3>N° 1: The fight club</h3>
        <p>my favorite movie by far, the dialogs, the plot twist at the end, the great work of all 3 main actors. Even the music they director choose is perfect for ambience of the movie.</p>

        <h3>N° 2: Star Wars Saga</h3>
        <p>I can do an extensive text explinin it detail by detail why this movies are one od the best sagas that humanity has ever made. But, if havent seen them, you really need to do it...Right now</p>

        <h3>N° 3: Lord of the rings saga</h3>
        <p>Really? Do you need me to explain it?</p>

        <h3>N°4: Kill Bill Vol I & Vol II</h3>
        <p>Just because Quentin Tarantino, thats why</p>
